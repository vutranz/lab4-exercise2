        The moment they land at the airport, we want our international students to experience our warmth, commitment, and passion for our students. No matter their language skills, we work to establish relationships right away. Performing academically and socially in an unfamiliar language is difficult and painful, but we know that when students feel individually valued and personally known, they are more likely to stretch towards opportunities to practice their English language skills.
